# Simple_Inetrest_Calculator_App
 A simple interest app made using Xamarin forms. It has a very simple layout where the user needs to enter principle amount, interest rate
 and number of years. Two buttons are made one to calculate the interest and the other to clear all the fields. What we get as output are
 interest amount and total amount. The UI is made to be attractive. Two different fonts are used along with modern colors.
